CardLayout places components in the container as cards.
Only one card is visible at a time, and the container acts as a
stack of cards. The ordering of cards is determined by the
container's own internal ordering of its component objects.
CardLayout defines a set of methods that allow an application to
flip through these cards sequentially, or to show a specified card
directly.
